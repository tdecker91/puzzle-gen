Square 1 is unique because it isn't a symetrical face turning puzzle. Puzzle Gen was really only built to handle those kinds of puzzles. So certain features don't work. For example, any option where settings dependon on face (ex, `stickerColors`, `mask`, etc...). Perhaps this will be supported in the future, but for now there aren't any plans to implement these features. `scheme` does work though :)
